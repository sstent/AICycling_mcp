Please suggest my next cycling workout based on my recent training history. Use the get_activities tool to get my recent activities and analyze the training pattern.

{training_rules_section}

Please provide:
1. Analysis of my recent training pattern
2. Identified gaps or imbalances in my training
3. Specific workout recommendation for my next session
4. Target zones (power, heart rate, duration)
5. Rationale for the recommendation based on recent performance
6. Alternative options if weather/time constraints exist
7. How this fits into my overall training progression

Use additional tools like hrv_data or nightly_sleep to inform recovery status and workout readiness.
